# Hi there! üëã I'm [Your Name]  

I'm a B.Tech CS/IT student and an aspiring software engineer exploring the world of tech. I have a deep interest in AI, Blockchain, Game Development, and Cybersecurity. Currently, I'm sharpening my skills in DSA, learning APIs, Postman, MongoDB, and more while working on exciting projects.  

I'm fascinated by cutting-edge technologies and how they shape the future. My tech stack includes Java, C, Python, MERN Stack, MySQL, AI, and Machine Learning. I love breaking things to understand how they work and figuring things out one bug at a time. üõ†Ô∏èüêõ  

Outside of coding, I enjoy following the latest advancements in science, gaming, and creating tech-related content.
